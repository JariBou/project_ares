Ok so basically each player has 2 stacks: FrameStack and LateStack (Or I can do One stack of each in TickManager)

Attacks and shit are registered on FrameStack, and are sent to other players
Received Attacks are then registered into LateStack as well as Blocks and resolution is done according to what's on the stack


IMPORTANT:
- Stack does not imply order of resolution, everything is done at the same time basically
- Only "Collisions" are registered on the Stacks, If a player hits the air, the attack is not registered
- SHIT animation events are probably fired AFTER Update, hum... anyways we'll see later when we will be able to test
